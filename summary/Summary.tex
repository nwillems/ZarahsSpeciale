\section{Executive Summary}
The aim of the thesis is to empirically investigate the price effect on 
apartments in Copenhagen after opening of the metro, specifically the dependance
on distance to the nearest station.

The thesis is motivated by the inconclusive results provided by current 
literature, investigating the same effect on apartment prices in other larger 
cities. 

Agostini and Palmucci($2008$) proves a decreasing relation between 
distance and prices, while Chen et al. ($1997$) proves that the same effect is 
not present for the houses nearest to the stations, while maintaining similar 
properties for the remaining houses.

The analysis is done by setting up two econometric models:  A 
hedonic price effect model based on Rosen's theory from $1974$ which fits a 
function of house prices, the analysis uses the natural logarithm to a 
set of co-variates,  and an additive model using cubic smoothing splines to 
include a non-linear effect and give more flexibility to the model, to better 
capture the spatial dependence. The additional model is inspired by Hastie and 
Tibshirani( $1990$). 

The two models are estimated using a dataset covering all sales for 
apartments sold more than one time doing the period MÃ…NED $2000$ to April $
2013$. The 
dataset is separated in two periods, the time before and after the metro 
station closest to the apartment was opened. Since $2005$ it has been decided 
that the metro system should be expanded with an extra line, and from $2011$ 
the contstruction sites were established. The dataset could consist of 
apartment 
sales that are positively affected by an announcement effect or negatively 
affected 
be the noise from a construction site, the analysis does not take into account 
the expansion of the metro system, it only looks at  the finished $22$ 
stations, and how they have affected the apartment sales in Copenhagen, 
exclusive Frederiksberg. % Frederiksberg inklusiv?

The analysis includes three groups of variables: characteristics variable, 
spatial variable and neighborhood variables. The characteristics variables 
include variables describing the apartment. It is variables like size in 
square 
meters, number of rooms, age of the building, units in the building and 
floor. The spatial variables explain distance to the metro station, park and 
daycare. The neighborhood variables include average income in the apartments 
and school ranking, based on the average of grade-average for graduates. 

The additive model uses a technique to fit non-linear relationships to 
multivariate data. The additive model includes two concepts "`spline functions"
' and "`smoothers"'.  A spline function is used in the construction of a 
spline curve, where the spline curve is used to create a smoothing curve.  
The spline curve is a curve reacted by a piece wise polynomial, where two or 
more polynomials are combined to create a curve. The smoother is a technique to
summarize the trend for a response variable $Y$ and a function of one or more 
explanatory variables. The practical by a smoothing is that it does not use 
any fixed form on the explanatory variables.  An example of a smoother is the 
"`Moving average"'-technique. The smoother is simply building upon the idea 
that the dataset is split into pieces and on each piece of the dataset is 
fited an average, simple regression or polynomials, differ from the technique
there is used.

An important issue in the analysis is the trade-off between variance and 
bias, which plays an important role when the dataset is split into smaller 
intervals. A large interval produces a curve with high degree of smoothing, 
and 
estimates with low variance and high bias, because of high degree of 
smoothing and therefore greater distance between actual curve and smoothing 
curve.  The opposite will happen with small intervals, where the variance is 
high and the bias small.  In the additive model, are used a function called 
cubic smoothing spline, to balance the trade-off between variance and 
bias, is included a parameter that accounts for that. 





The hedonic model estimates show a linear relation between house prices and 
meter to a metro station. Apartment sales between $0$ and $200$ meters to a 
station, have experienced a high increase in the house prices after the 
station was opened. It is in that relation important to notice that some of 
the 
effect, can simply be because this apartments also was the one suffering the 
most from the noise and dust from the construction site, and therefore have
the prices on this apartment, been pushed down even more under the building 
process, and therefore will some of the raise in prices be related to the 
removing of the construction site, and not because the apartment, now is 
closer to a metro station.

The additive model, which gives additional flexibility permits more accurate 
estimation of the underlying spatial structure of the data. This should lead 
to more reliable results for the impact of having an apartment close to a 
metro station.
The estimates for the additive model, shows that the negative externalities by 
living close to a metro station matters. The model proves an upgoing trend 
from $0$
to $300$ meters from a metro station, while after $300$ meters to the station, 
the effect on house prices is falling if the apartment it placed further away 
from the metro station.   

The thesis is structured as follow: The first chapter gives a short
introduction to the Copenhagen metro system, the second chapter explains the 
theory behind the hedonic price model and the additive model, and also includes
a short model explaining how distance to public transport is affecting the 
house prices. Chapter three gives a description of the dataset, which goes over
in chapter four which gives an explanation of the variables constructed to use 
in the analysis. Chapter five to seven gives a closer description of the three 
different types of variables. Chapter eight describes the method behind the 
models. Chapter nine presents the estimation results. Chapter ten and eleven 
is 
summing up the thesis in a discussion of a closing conclusion.
